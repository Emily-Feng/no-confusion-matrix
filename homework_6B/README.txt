This is for Programming Usable Interfaces 05430 Spring 2021 Assignment 6 using starter code from homework 5.

Assignment 6A:
The goal of 6A is to build out the HTML+CSS of a shopping cart, add some JS to the Product 
Detail page to support different customization options, and to add some JS to show feedback for 
items being added to the shopping cart.

1. Create a NEW page.
    - The page should be a Shopping cart page where users can view items in their
        cart. Include the following prototypes: a low fidelity prototype, a high fidelity 
        prototype, and an implementation in HTML + CSS. Modify your existing web 
        store files as needed.
    - If you had a shopping cart page already, choose a new type of page to 
        implement (Special Offers, Order Tracking, etc.). You need to design high 
        fidelity prototypes, and an implementation in HTML+CSS (no JavaScript). 
        This is to ensure everyone does the same amount of work for this assignment. 
        The remainder of the assignment that uses Javascript to add functionality will 
        be implemented on the shopping cart page.


2. Create NEW features for your site.
    - The user can modify options on the Product Detail page (the size, quantity, etc.).
    - The Product Detail page should change according to the userâ€™s selection. For
        example, if a user selected a Tiny Fire Orange Cat Harness, the page should 
        update with the details of that product (i.e. update size, color and image). 
        This should NOT be a new HTML file. Use JavaScript to implement this functionality.
    - The user can add products to their shopping cart. There should be some visual 
        indication to the user of how many items they have in their shopping cart for each 
        page showing the shopping cart link.
